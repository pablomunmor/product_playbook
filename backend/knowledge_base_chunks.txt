Start Your Journey The Four Big Risks Every product faces these fundamental challenges. Master them, and you'll build products that win. 💎 Value Risk Will customers actually want this? The graveyard of products is full of "solutions" nobody asked for. 🎯 Usability Risk Can users actually figure out how to use it? Even the most valuable solution fails if it's confusing. ⚡ Feasibility Risk Can we actually build this with our team, timeline, and tech stack? Dreams meet reality here. 🚀 Viability Risk Will this work for our business?
Legal, financial, operational - the business model has to add up. The Product Journey Four phases that transform ideas into impact. Each phase has its purpose, tools, and mindset. 1 Define Start with the end in mind. What's the vision? Who are we serving? What problem are we solving?

--- # 📄 docs/BRD.md ```markdown # Business Requirements Document (BRD) – Product Manager's Playbook ## Objective Build a **self-contained, interactive playbook** for product managers of all levels. It balances **education** (core principles, best practices, anti-patterns, references) with **practicality** (editable templates, auto-calculations, export options). It must function as both a **training resource** and a **day-to-day workbench**. ## Business Goals - Standardize product management processes and frameworks across teams. - Onboard new PMs faster by providing lifecycle education in one place. - Equip experienced PMs with ready-to-use templates and scoring systems. - Enable PMs to export/share outputs (Miro, Confluence, decks). - Create a living tool that emphasizes continuous learning. ## Success Metrics - **Adoption:** Number of PMs using the playbook weekly. - **Retention:** % of PMs who reuse templates over multiple sessions.
- **Learning impact:** Reduced onboarding time, self-reported competency increases. - **Practicality:** # of screenshots/exports used in workflows.
# Technical Specification – Product Manager's Playbook ## Architecture The project uses a hybrid architecture: a static frontend for the user interface and a local Python backend to power the AI Assistant. ### Frontend - **Single-file HTML** (main.html) for structure and content. - **Vanilla JS** for UI interactivity, template management (LocalStorage persistence, reset logic), and screenshot export. - **CSS** embedded within the HTML for styling. - **[html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/)** library for the PNG export functionality. ### Backend (AI Assistant) - **Framework**: Python with Flask. - **Function**: Provides a local API endpoint (`/api/chat`) for the RAG system. - **Core Libraries**: - `sentence-transformers`: For generating text embeddings. - `faiss-cpu`: For creating and searching the vector index (knowledge base). - **Structure**: All backend code is contained within the `/backend` directory.
## Data Model - LocalStorage key format: `PMPlaybook.[Phase].[TemplateName].[Field]` - Prioritization Framework formula: Score = (Opp * 0.35) + (Cust * 0.20) + (Feas * 0.10) + (Strat * 0.35) markdown Copy code ## Scoring Tables **Opportunity Value (35%)** - 1 = < $100K - 1.5 = $100K–$500K - 2 = $500K–$1M - 2.5 = $1M–$1.5M - 3 = $1.5M–$2.5M - 3.5 = $2.5M–$3.5M - 4 = > $3.5M **Operational Value** - 1 = negligible (<$1M savings) - 2 = moderate ($1M–$3M savings) - 3 = significant ($3M–$5M savings) - 4 = very high (> $5M savings) **Customer Value (20%)** - 1 = negligible impact - 2 = moderate improvement - 3 = strong alignment + high desirability - 4 = very high desirability and reach **Feasibility Value (10%)** - 0 = no available tech, no confidence - 1 = new tech/complex effort, low confidence - 2 = significant enhancements, low–medium confidence - 3 = moderate enhancements, medium–high confidence - 4 = existing tech, high confidence **Strategic Value (35%)** - 1 = negligible impact - 2 = measurable contribution, somewhat foundational - 3 = significant, foundational unlocks - 4 = critical, measurable contribution, foundational unlock ## Components 1.

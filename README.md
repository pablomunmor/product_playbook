# Business Requirements Document (BRD) â€“ Product Manager's Playbook

## Objective
Build a **self-contained, interactive playbook** for product managers of all levels.  
It balances **education** (core principles, best practices, anti-patterns, references) with **practicality** (editable templates, auto-calculations, export options).  
It must function as both a **training resource** and a **day-to-day workbench**.

## Business Goals
- Standardize product management processes and frameworks across teams.
- Onboard new PMs faster by providing lifecycle education in one place.
- Equip experienced PMs with ready-to-use templates and scoring systems.
- Enable PMs to export/share outputs (Miro, Confluence, decks).
- Create a living tool that emphasizes continuous learning.

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption:** Number of PMs using the playbook weekly.
- **Retention:** % of PMs who reuse templates over multiple sessions.
- **Learning impact:** Reduced onboarding time, self-reported competency increases.
- **Practicality:** # of screenshots/exports used in workflows.
